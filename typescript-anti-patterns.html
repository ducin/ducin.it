</em></p>


<p><strong>The purpose of this article is to avoid common mistakes while using TypeScript</strong>. I&#39;ve been using
	TS in several <em>big-to-very-big</em> commercial projects since early 2015. Throughout that time I&#39;ve encountered
	some misconceptions and mistakes about declaring types, as well as I was asked questions during my TypeScript
	trainings. Some of them reappear pretty often, so I made my best to extract the common roots of the misconceptions and
	explained them below.</p>

</ul>
<p>TypeScript is all about restricting the types of expressions and variables we use. It&#39;s about reducing what we
	can do with our own (or extenal) code. So expect that all the following topics will relate to making our type
	definitions more strict :).</p>
<h2 id="-1-overusing-the-any-type">#1 Overusing the <code>any</code> Type</h2>
<p>Yes, this has to be point no. 1 since it&#39;s the most often. Unfortunately, it happens too often that developers
	believe the promise of better code quality with static typing, but they don&#39;t will to spend this little bit more
	time on precisely defining the types they use. And it needs repeating over and over again: <strong>you shall (almost)
		never use <code>any</code></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="-2-overusing-classes">#2 Overusing Classes</h2>
<p>Many developers who come from class-based languages such as Java, C#, PHP, etc. feel a relief when finally finding
	out that we can have (statically) typed JavaScript. That&#39;s refreshing and I felt the same some time ago :) And -
	as long as TypeScript allows to write both Object-Oriented (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) - many of us take OOP
	as the default choice and keep on introducing classes throughout the TypeScript code. If we need to have multiple
	instances - that&#39;s expected. But <strong>if we need only a single instance - wrapping the logic with a class is
		just not needed</strong>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I&#39;m <strong>not</strong> favouring one over the other (OOP vs FP), each has its strengths and
	weaknesses.</p>
<p>When using TypeScript, we should consider two concepts:</p>
<h3 id="instantiating-a-class-introduces-complexity">instantiating a class introduces complexity</h3>
<p>Before we can use the logic of a class, first we have to call the constructor to get the instance. We need to decide
	who creates the instance (responsibility, ownership) and when to do it. Although it&#39;s not a <em>huge</em>
	complexity (are there any means to measure it?), still, it&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">some
		complexity which doesn&#39;t have to be there (see <em>accidental complexity</em>)</a>. The <em>essential complexity</em>
	lies in the methods themselves. Also, passing arguments through a class constructor is not always needed, e.g. if the
	value is available via <code>import</code> statement.</p>
<p>Instead, if we need only a single instance, we can define an object literal, thereby removing the need for calling
	the constructor. We can have the instance straight away. Using object literals is idiomatic JavaScript. And TypeScript
	is just JavaScript + static typing.</p>
<h3 id="type-inference-works-very-well-for-object-literals">type inference works very well for object literals</h3>
<p>Type safety for classes is great:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">class MyValidator {
    validateEmail(email: string): boolean { 
        return true; // :P
    }
}

const validator = new MyValidator()
validator.validateEmail() // throws</code></pre>
<p>but <strong>type safety for object literals - thanks to type inference - is just as well</strong>. We don&#39;t lose
	anything:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const myValidator = {
    validateEmail(email: string): boolean { 
        return true; // :P
    }
}

validator.validateEmail() // throws</code></pre>
<p>Basically, let&#39;s not overcomplicate our code. You might not need a class, if an object literal - or even a set
	of functions (if the object was meant to be stateless) - would do the job.</p>
<h2 id="-3-using-the-function-type">#3 Using the <code>Function</code> Type</h2>
<p>This one is important whenever our APIs accept callbacks and we want to restrict that certain parameters of
	functions/methods are themselves functions. So what should be the type of the callback function?</p>
<p>Although TypeScript allows to use the <code>Function</code> type, it&#39;s very rarely a good idea, since it&#39;s
	very rare just <em>any</em> function. And <code>Function</code> is like the <code>any</code> type applied to
	functions. It tells us only that an expression of this type is invokable/callable (we can invoke/call the function
	with given arguments). But most often we do know <strong>what parameters such function supports</strong> and we can
	improve type safety. With <code>Function</code> we lose not only the input parameters types, but also the result type.</p>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type aThing = {
  doSomeLogic(cb: Function)
}</code></pre>
<p>we should define function types, such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type ArithmeticFn = (a: number, b: number) =&gt; number
type aThing = {
  doSomeLogic(cb: ArithmeticFn)
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="-4-messing-up-with-type-inference">#4 Messing up with Type Inference</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s take a snippet from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qklnVKgxMIY&amp;t=6m23s">this angular video
		tutorial</a>. This small snippet is basically about creating an immutable copy of a <code>course</code> object with a
	modified <code>description</code> field:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">// original item to be changed in an immutable manner
const course = this.courses[0];

const newCourse: any = {...course};
newCourse.description = &#39;New Value!&#39;;
this.courses[0] = newCourse;</code></pre>
<p>Whether we want the code to be a one-liner or not (preferences, conventions, whatever...) we should use <em>idiomatic</em>
	JavaScript and let the type inference do everything for us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const course = this.courses[0];
const newCourse = {...course, description: &#39;New Value!&#39;};
this.courses[0] = newCourse;</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the object destructuring with overriding a certain field is really enough for TypeScript to infer the
	<code>newCourse</code> variable precisely. And to find out that <code>newCourse</code> is type compatible with <code>course</code>
	both ways :) The general rule of thumb is that sometimes removing <code>any</code> will allow type inference to do all
	the job (occurence of <code>any</code> is redundant and actually harmful).</p>
<p>Just want to emphasize, that <a href="https://angular-university.io">Angular University</a> (who created above
	video) provides really great content and I don&#39;t mean to criticize it, just nobody is perfect and this mistake is
	worth analyzing.</p>
<h2 id="-5-copy-pasting-partial-type-definitions">#5 Copy-Pasting partial Type Definitions</h2>
<p>There are lots of neat tricks we can use in order to avoid creating types manually or copy-pasting parts of types
	with or without applying changes. Here are some of them.</p>
<h3 id="extracting-the-type-of-an-existing-literal-object">Extracting the type of an existing Literal Object</h3>
<p>Example usecase: we&#39;re diving into a big legacy JS application. We find that there&#39;s a global config object
	defined like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var Configuration = {
  API: &quot;http://host/path/to/api&quot;,
  token: &quot;jw3t-4w4j-5t04-5jt0-445t-fe98&quot;,
  locale: &quot;en-us&quot;,
  language: &quot;en&quot;,
  currency: &quot;USD&quot;,
  modules: [&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;orders&quot;, &quot;stock&quot;]
}</code></pre>
<p>And it&#39;s passed as an argument to many functions throughout the codebase. What type should we provide for this
	config?</p>
<p>We can define the whole type from scratch, but we don&#39;t have to. Simply, use <code>typeof</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type AppConfig = typeof Configuration</code></pre>
<p>to get the type (<code>type AppConfig = { API: string; token: string; locale: string; lang: string; currency: string; modules: string[]; }</code>)</p>
<h4 id="example-entity">example entity</h4>
<p>For the rest of examples, let&#39;s use a pretty big <code>Employee</code> entity from my IT Corpo mock API which I
	use during my trainings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type Employee = {
  &quot;id&quot;: number;
  &quot;nationality&quot;: Nationality,
  &quot;departmentId&quot;: number;
  &quot;keycardId&quot;: string;
  &quot;account&quot;: string;
  &quot;salary&quot;: Money;
  &quot;office&quot;: [string, string];
  &quot;firstName&quot;: string;
  &quot;lastName&quot;: string;
  &quot;title&quot;: string;
  &quot;contractType&quot;: ContractType;
  &quot;email&quot;: Email;
  &quot;hiredAt&quot;: DateString;
  &quot;expiresAt&quot;: DateString;
  &quot;personalInfo&quot;: {
    &quot;age&quot;: number;
    &quot;phone&quot;: Phone;
    &quot;email&quot;: Email;
    &quot;dateOfBirth&quot;: DateString;
    &quot;address&quot;: {
      &quot;street&quot;: string;
      &quot;city&quot;: string;
      &quot;country&quot;: string;
    };
  },
  &quot;skills&quot;: Skill[];
  &quot;bio&quot;: string;
};</code></pre>
<h3 id="lookup-types">Lookup Types</h3>
<p>Example usecase: need to fetch employees that are assigned to a certain department (<code>&quot;departmentId&quot;: number</code>).</p>
<p>Although the following should work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const getEmployeesByDepartmentId = (departmentId: number): Response { ... }</code></pre>
<p>it&#39;s not a good idea to do it, because it will work <em>now</em>. That&#39;s not easy to spot, but in the code
	above we&#39;re losing the <em>single source of truth</em> about the <code>Employee</code> entity shape, when
	introducing a loose <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>departmentId</code> should be a derivative of the <code>Employee</code> entity, in TypeScript we call it a
	<em>lookup type</em> (we could optionally create a separate typedef for this field&#39;s type):</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const getEmployeesByDepartmentId = (departmentId: Employee[&quot;departmentId&quot;]): Response { ... }</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to it, whenever the <code>Employee</code> entity gets updated, all places that depend on its derivatives get
	updated and potentially our components/redux/ngrx/whatever code will throw errors, since <code>number</code> is now
	expected to be a <code>string</code> (guid). If we leave just <code>departmentId: number</code>, we get a silent fail.
	o_O</p>
<p>That&#39;s a good strategy especially for long-living, big applications that are likely to evolve over time. Just
	keep the <em>single source of truth</em>.</p>
<h3 id="mapped-types-and-conditional-types">Mapped Types and Conditional Types</h3>
<p>Need to use the type, but in a slightly modified version?</p>
<p>Example usecase: let&#39;s say, our app has to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_verb">HTTP PATCH
		requests</a>, that is, modify an existing resource, but instead of replacing existing one with <em>the whole</em> new
	value (<code>HTTP PUT</code>), we pass only the part that changed. For instance, our interface supports changing the
	<code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> values via input in a <em>profile</em> form, changing the <code>contractType</code>
	(enumeration) via a dropdown in a <em>contracts</em> form and <code>skills</code> list in a <em>résumé</em> form. Oh,
	and changing <code>personalInfo</code> is possible via another form. All changes should be possible independently.</p>
<p>Using <code>HTTP PUT</code> we&#39;d have to load existing entity, apply the changes and resend the whole object. In
	some situations this loading + applying is not necessary, thus <code>HTTP PATCH</code>, which sends just <em>the diff</em>.
	What we&#39;re aiming at is providing a type that will allow to define any part of the entity - and will be used to
	update only the pieces that our form supports.</p>
<p>In TypeScript that&#39;s super simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type PartialFieldsEmployee = Partial&lt;Employee&gt;;</code></pre>
<p><code>Partial</code> is an example of so called <em>Mapped Types</em>. The idea behind these is to basically map
	over all fields of an object&#39;s type apply a chang and return the new type. So it works similarly to Array.map in
	JavaScript. The internals of <code>Partial</code>, which BTW works as well, are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type Partial&lt;T&gt; = {
    [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};</code></pre>
<p>TypeScript is just applying the <code>?</code> to <strong>make all fields optional on the top level</strong>. You
	can do the opposite (make all fields required) by applying <code>Required</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type RequiredFieldsEmployee = Required&lt;PartialFieldsEmployee&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>it&#39;s internals are analogical:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type Required&lt;T&gt; = { [P in keyof T]-?: T[P] };</code></pre>
<h3 id="accessing-internal-types-of-an-external-library">Accessing Internal types of an External Library</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve had experience with <a href="https://js.devexpress.com/">devextreme</a>. First thing that comes to my mind
	about this library is that its support for TypeScript could be way better. Bottom-line for us, developers: sometimes
	you encounter a great, full-featured JS library which has pretty limited TS support and gotta deal with it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/blob/a59d62732b3d38fb03cd48de3e492a6a0b0440d4/ts/dx.all.d.ts">github
		snapshot (browsing code from the latest commit at the time of writing this article, December 30, 2018)</a>.</p>
<h4 id="example-usecase-you-need-to-access-the-return-type-of-a-grid-method">Example usecase: you need to access the
	return type of a grid method</h4>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/blob/a59d62732b3d38fb03cd48de3e492a6a0b0440d4/ts/dx.all.d.ts#L2482">the
		line of our interest</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">export class dxDataGrid extends GridBase {
  ...
  getSelectedRowKeys(): Array&lt;any&gt; &amp; Promise&lt;any&gt; &amp; JQueryPromise&lt;any&gt;;
}</code></pre>
<p>Same as above, we don&#39;t want to copy-paste it, since it would desync us from the original type definition (new
	releases of the library that introduce any change to the type would make our code break). Instead of copying the
	datatype, let&#39;s access it with <code>ReturnType</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type GridSelectedRowKeys = ReturnType&lt;dxDataGrid[&quot;getSelectedRowKeys&quot;]&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, above is a combination of the <code>ReturnType</code> conditional type and a type lookup. This works
	since <code>dxDataGrid</code> is a type definition. If we&#39;ve had an implementation (instead of an interface), like
	the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">function myFn(): ABC {
  return someData;
}</code></pre>
<p>then <code>ReturnType&lt;myFn&gt;</code> <strong>would not work</strong>, because we&#39;re mixing the type context
	with implementation context. We need to <em>dump</em> the implementation of <code>myFn</code> down to it&#39;s type
	with <code>typeof myFn</code> and access it further with <code>ReturnType&lt;...&gt;</code> same as above. That makes:
	<code>ReturnType&lt;typeof myFn&gt;</code>. It works correctly, since <code>ReturnType</code> expects the generic
	passed to be a type, and what it gets is indeed a type definition (not an implementation).</p>
<h4 id="another-example-usecase-we-need-to-access-a-grid-s-method-parameter-type">Another example usecase: we need to
	access a grid&#39;s method parameter type</h4>
<p>In ideal world, it would just be exported as a type. But apparently, it&#39;s not. Funfact, the method accepts only
	1 parameter, <em>the event_, which has _lots</em> of fields and we need to use this event somewhere else in our
	application. And no copy-pasting.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/blob/a59d62732b3d38fb03cd48de3e492a6a0b0440d4/ts/dx.all.d.ts#L2392">the
		line of our interest</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">export class dxDataGrid extends GridBase {
  ...
  onCellHoverChanged?: ((e: {
    component?: dxDataGrid,
    element?: DevExpress.core.dxElement,
    model?: any,
    eventType?: string,
    data?: any,
    key?: any,
    value?: any,
    text?: string,
    displayValue?: any,
    columnIndex?: number,
    rowIndex?: number,
    column?: dxDataGridColumn,
    rowType?: string,
    cellElement?: DevExpress.core.dxElement,
    row?: dxDataGridRowObject
  }) =&gt; any);
}</code></pre>
<p>Originally, that&#39;s a single line for the library&#39;s internal convention consistency, here broken down for
	readability. We need to access what is the type of <code>e</code> above. The following code does the job:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type FirstParameterType&lt;T&gt; = T extends (e: infer R) =&gt; any ? R : any;
type OnCellHoverChangedEvent = FirstParameterType&lt;dxDataGrid[&quot;onCellHoverChanged&quot;]&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s probably one of the most complex pieces in this post, so it requires additional explanation. The <code>FirstParameterType</code>
	is a <em>conditional type</em> which allows us to intercept the function signature (note: not a function
	body/implementation!) and extract it&#39;s first parameter. The syntax basically requires us to put <code>infer R</code>
	in the spot we want to infer and <code>? R : any</code> as the <em>resulting type</em> (<code>R</code> - the inferred
	one, if matched, otherwise <code>any</code>). So the <code>FirstParameterType</code>, given a function signature as
	its generic type, will return the type of the first parameter.</p>
<p>We access the method signature via <code>dxDataGrid[&quot;onCellHoverChanged&quot;]</code>. So all in all, our
	solution is: <code>FirstParameterType&lt;dxDataGrid[&quot;onCellHoverChanged&quot;]&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Pay attention not to make your types to broad, especially, don&#39;t make them allow <em>anything</em>. And try to
	keep as many single sources of truth for your type definitions as possible - and anywhere you need to reuse it - make
	it a derivative type instead of a modified copied typedef.</p>
