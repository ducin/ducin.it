  "description": "Recent release of Angular 17.1 (yesterday, 18th January 2024), introduces Signal Inputs. It's a good opportunity to rethink migrating from RxJS to Signals, as more and more APIs are signal-based: the framework (signals, computeds, effects and the rxjs-interop) and ecosystem (NGRX signal store), as well as tons of experiments (such as this one).",

  "description": "The &quot;hot and cold&quot; observables concept is quite useful when we introduce RxJS to a complete beginner. But as soon as they dive into real project usecases, e.g. late subscription of a newly rendered component that subscribes to a (behavior? replay?) subject which had already emitted something - then the &quot;hot and cold&quot; concept is... harmful.",
